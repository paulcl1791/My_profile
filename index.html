            <a class="text">Hello, my name is Paul Chautard.<br></a> 
            <img src="images/IMG_4955.jpg"><br>
            I am currently a student at the Leonardo da Vinci School of Management. Hereâ€™s my profile I was able to code thanks to the Wagon site.<br>Discover:<br></a>

         <h2>Personality<h2>
         <a class="text">
            About my personality, I am very passionate. I am completely invested in my projects both professional and personal. My main qualities are honesty, resilience and determination. As for my faults, I am not very patient and can sometimes be too frank. The values I hold dear are courage, humility and brotherhood.

        <h2>Hobbies<h2>
        <a class="text">
            My main extracurricular activity is the sport I practice either at home or outside. My favorite sport is surfing, which I have been practicing regularly on holiday for about 7 years. I regularly run alone or with friends to work on my cardio. For a few months I also practice English boxing once a week minimum through my business school. 
            My other hobbies are going out to see friends for example or to party as well as listen to music. I also sometimes just watch TV shows on platforms like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/"> Netflix or <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/?ref_=dvm_pds_amz_FR_lb_s_g_mkw_saaJk492B-dc_pcrid_511832512780&mrntrk=slid__pgrid_64418049261_pgeo_9056493_x__ptid_kwd-315980808214">Amazon prime.
